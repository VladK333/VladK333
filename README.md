# 👋 Hi, I'm Vladana Aleksić

I'm a Software Engineering undergraduate at the Faculty of Technical Sciences, University of Novi Sad, Serbia.  
My main interest is backend development, but I'm also learning frontend through online courses to broaden my perspective.  
I'm open to projects that can help me grow, learn, and build my career in IT.  
I'm especially interested in opportunities that will expand my current knowledge and allow me to apply what I've learned so far in real-world scenarios.
